<div class="header">Gordan Parks</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Gordon Parks was an artist, photographer, author, and filmmaker who created
  his work with a strong drive for social activism. Born in Fort, Kansas, Parks
  grew up in poverty and segregation. As a young man he became interested in
  photography and managed to buy a camera from a pawn shop, with which he taught
  himself to photograph. Parks said, “I saw that the camera could be a weapon
  against poverty, against racism, against all sorts of social wrongs. I knew at
  that point I had to have a camera.” His talent and vision brought him far, and
  he eventually started working professionally. Parks is well known for his
  stunning capture of the effects of poverty and racism within urban
  communities. One of his more well-known photos is titled Emerging Man, which
  depicts a young black man cautiously emerging from the ground with a manhole
  cover lifted above his head. The photo was part of a photo-essay titled A Man
  Becomes Invisible which was inspired by none other than Ralph Ellison and his
  novel Invisible Man which was mentioned earlier. This theme of invisibility
  has survived and is still very relevant to the existence of African-Americans.
  The work is a commentary on the social status of African-Americans as
  second-class citizens. Under Jim Crow, they were given significantly worse
  facilities and institutions. They were continually politically disenfranchised
  and many were in economic disparity. In fear of white supermicist attack or
  police brutality they were made to be quiet. An idea often addressed in
  Ellison’s novel Invisible Man is loss of identity and the physiological impact
  of constant racism and discrimination. Often in history, a group of oppressed
  people can become clumped together so we understand their struggle as it
  affects their community as whole, however the impact of racism deeply injured
  the soul, spirit, brain, and worth of the individual because they were
  constantly treated as less. Another famous image of Parks is American Gothic
  which is a play off of the well-known painting American Gothic created by
  Grant Wood. Parks replaces the elderly white farmer couple holding a pitchfork
  in front of a farmhouse with a singular middle aged black woman holding a
  broom and a mop in front of an American flag. This photo makes commentary on
  the reality of who works and maintains America which is often lower or
  middle-class people of color. The blank expression of the woman creates a tone
  of tiredness. Black people built the country as slaves and continues to
  maintain it for no credit. American Gothic blurs the loud boastful American
  flag in the background and instead focuses on the main character, who was a
  real mother and working woman. >

<div class="header">Clementine Hunter</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Clementine Hunter was born in Natchitoches, Louisiana and lived and worked on
  the Melrose cotton plantation for most of her life. She didn’t start painting
  until her later years and could only paint during her free time at night after
  working all day. She worked on any surface she could find, including canvas,
  wood, gourds, paper, wine bottles, iron pots, cutting boards, and milk jugs.
  Her paintings were almost always created from memory and depicted her daily
  life with images such as cotton fields, baptisms, and funerals being common.
  Her lack of professional training makes her illustrations of southern
  African-American life very genuine and heartfelt, because she was simply
  painting her surroundings. Through her artwork we can see how life in the
  south had maintained its loyalty to the cotton industry and how the physical
  work was still the same. Her depiction of black mothers helps us understand
  the crucial and difficult position they had in order to maintain the home. The
  importance of religion has remained, but we can now see that in the years
  since slavery it has become the bustling center of the black community. In the
  depths of slavery, spirituality was a quiet savior, and while it was unchanged
  in the way that it promoted and maintained hope and perseverence, it is at
  this time a center for social gathering, protection, and philanthropy. >

<div class="header">We Shall Overcome</div>
<div class="analysis">
  One of the most famous anthems of the movement for black equality was We Shall
  Overcome. The repetitive nature of the lyrics makes it feel like an inner
  monolog, a prayer, or a hymn. The song serves as a reassurance that change
  will come and that peace is not only possible but that it shall happen. It is
  a positive song of upliftment and inspiration. Although it says “We are not
  afraid” over and over, it is sadly very telling of the threatening climate
  that black people had to overcome. >
</div>
<div class="header">A Change is Gonna Come</div>
<div class="analysis">
  A Change is Gonna Come is also a song of positivity that affirms a bright
  future for the black community. However while We Shall Overcome focuses on a
  fixed positive message and looks towards the future, this song lingers on the
  current pains of the black experience, then returns to the certainty of
  change. The first stanza talks about the familiarity of running. This is
  reflective of African-Americans’ denial of safety and security in their
  homeland. Oppression has kept them running, away from slavery, away from
  violence, away to the north in search of safety and opportunity. The
  relationship between death and the difficulty of existence is also created,
  expressing the reality of black struggle. While segregation was banned with
  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, racial discrimination was still very apparent as
  told in the stanza which says “I go to the movie. And I go downtown. Somebody
  keep telling me don’t hang around.” The idea of black disunity is also
  referenced in the lines which read,”Then I go to my brother and I say,
  brother, help me please. But he winds up, knockin’ me down on my knees.” This
  expresses the issue of black people avoiding confrontation out of fear
  perhaps, jadedness, or something else. But the song ends on a positive note,
  once again reassuring that change will come. >

<div class="header">Otis Redding</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Otis Redding’s Sittin on the Dock of The Bay is a song about migration.
  Redding explains his departure from Georgia in order to settle in San
  Francisco because of the lack of opportunity in the South for black people.
  The “two thousand miles” he roamed is a reflection of the desperate measures
  African-Americans were willing to take in order to join the Great Migration.
  Redding’s lyrics take on a tone of apathy because “nothings gonna change” and
  “everything still still remains the same”. This expresses the feelings of
  discontentment within the black community because of continuous neglect and
  oppression. >

<div class="header">Mississippi Goddam</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam addresses the oppressively racist and violent
  atmosphere of the south that the whole nation was aware of. The song was made
  out of frustration for the injustices that had been inflicted upon black
  people. The line “I think every day’s gonna be my last '' expresses the state
  of constant fear that southern black people lived in, with the KKK still
  active as well as a general culture of racism. The line “School children
  sitting in jail” expresses the difficulty of being an activist in the south,
  many of which were young individuals and students. Fear of death and jail kept
  black southerners disenfranchised and oppressed. Prayer is also questioned by
  Simone, which reflects the shifting attitude of black activists who were tired
  of passiveness, and perhaps did not see God as their savior anymore because of
  years of pain and oppression. Not only is religion questioned but also the
  idea of conformity. Years of scrutiny had many African-Americans up until now
  under the impression that perhaps if they worked to rise to the level of white
  living and scrubbed themselves of blackness they could be treated equally.
  This respect and equality was never given however and was never intended to be
  given. Simone also rants about the rate at which change was happening by
  creating a parallel between white people demanding efficiency from the work of
  black people and black people demanding efficiency in the changing of policy
  and society. Overall Mississippi Goddam is about frustration with rampant
  southern racism and the enabling political idleness that everyone was aware
  of. >

<div class="header">Nina Simone</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Four women describes four different women of varying skin tones as well as the
  treatment they receive for their uncontrollable outward appearances. The First
  Lady, with black skin, speaks of her strength or the expectation of her
  strength and her ability to withstand pain “again and again”. This expresses
  the history of black women especially with darker skin being denied gentle
  treatment that would otherwise be received if it weren’t for their denial of
  femininity. Black women’s femininity was only acknowledged by whites when they
  were seen as sexual objects by their white slave masters or by the white men
  they worked for later on. Outside of that, their womanhood was not recognized
  and they were expected to work as hard as a man, not left out of slavery,
  peonage, or any harsh labor. The dark skinned woman is also called Aunt Sarah,
  giving her an identity of perhaps an older lady or a caretaker instead of
  simply a woman. The second woman has yellow skin. She addresses the difficult
  position that mixed race individuals were in, as they could not be fully
  accepted by either race. She also mentions her conceivement which was by the
  rape of her black mother by the rich white man she probably worked for. This
  speaks to the accessibility of black women by white men while working in their
  homes where they could do little to protect themselves. The third woman, with
  tan skin, is seen as attractive because of her lighter skin and is seen as a
  sexual object which is apparent in what they call her, Sweet Thing. The final
  woman with brown skin speaks of the difficulty of her life due to her skin
  color. She has felt the pain of racism which has been passed down from
  parents’ life as slaves. Simone brings to light the very important issue of
  colorism in the discussion of race, recognizing that the shades of a black
  peoples’ skin will give them varying experiences of racism. This is also very
  relevant during a time of black pride, when African-Americans were embracing
  their blackness and expressing their beauty. Four Women marries the two
  experiences of being a woman and being black to address the complexity of this
  identity. Simone is creating a discussion about black femininity, analyzing
  its intricacies in order to bring pride to the black female identity. >

<div class="header">I Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to be Free</div>
<div class="analysis">
  I Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to be Free is yet another black freedom song
  created by Nina Simone. The song has a simple yet strong message as Simone
  expresses her longing for freedom, or rather freedom for all black people. Her
  choice of phrasing, saying that she wishes she knew how it would feel to be
  free expresses how this right has never been known to black people because
  they have never truly been free in America, even after emancipation. This is
  proof from the individual that they are not free because they have never felt
  free, despite society telling them that they are. This is a reflection of the
  technical equality given to black people by law that does not correlate to the
  reality of oppression and discrimination. >
</div>
<div class="header">Say it Loud:I'm Black and I'm Proud</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Say it Loud I’m Black and I’m Proud, sung by James Brown, is an anthem of
  black pride and a representation of the frustration from years of oppression
  that fueled black civil rights activists to shift to a more assertive approach
  in their demands for equality. Many freedom songs during this time took on
  this tone of frustration, similar to that of Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam.
  Brown opens with the fact that any form of black assertiveness is often
  demonized and viewed as aggression or malice. He defends black rebels and
  promises that they will not cease until they have the rights they deserve. The
  song acts as a breaking point, laying out all of the torture of
  African-American history due to their work for the white man and demanding
  justice for how they were wronged. This is once again a reflection of the new
  wave black liberation movement during the 1960s in which black people took
  pride in their strength and their history and shaped their anger into demands
  for peace. Looking back through history this is a dramatic shift from black
  peoples rightfully passive resistance during enslavement. The chorus of the
  song “Say it loud: I’m black and I’m proud” is repeated throughout the song
  and is a reflection of the large black power movement that was taking shape
  during the 1960s. This culture encouraged blackness to be not just recognized
  and accepted but embraced and celebrated. >

<div class="header">Barkley L Hendricks</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Barkley L Hendricks was an artist from Philadelphia who focused primarily on
  creating portraits of African-Americans. He used his artwork to portray the
  black subject in a light of elegance and strength. His portraits usually
  depicted African-Americans with their natural hair, in very stylish clothing
  from the 60s and 70s. His paintings serve as an upliftment of the black
  individual, making them the sole subject of the painting with no distraction.

<div class="header">Maya Angelou</div>
<div class="analysis">
  Maya Angelou’s Still I Rise is a powerful literary work that directs it’s
  clever attitude towards a white audience. Angelou confronts her reader with
  uncomfortable questions about their perception of her black identity, laying
  out the thoughts of her oppressor. The poem functions in an interesting way in
  that it makes self-derogatory comments, but takes control of these comments to
  uplift herself. She makes their judgment and their hatred her power. This work
  is also very important in that it speaks to the experience of the black woman.
  Angelou uses the scrutinized characteristics of her black female identity to
  her advantage, weaponizing her sass and confronting the reader with the
  boastful acceptance of her femininity and sexiness. She embraces the history
  of her black identity, connecting the past of slavery to her powerful
  existence today. Angelou is defiant in her words. She is telling her audience
  that the oppressed are strong and will always overcome their oppressor. That
  no matter the hatred and violence inflicted upon them, they will rise above.
  This tone of assertiveness is representative of new wave black pride once
  again. Angelou expresses pride in herself communicates her anger with grace,
  power, and light-heartedness. This is symbolic of the strength and beauty of
  her identity and represents the collective black feminine experience. >
